When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repository allows makes it more accesible to work on projects. You don't always need your local machne in order to work on your project. It also makes collaborating with others much more efficient. Remote repositories are very useful when you want to access your files in a machine other than your local machine as well as working with others on projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes we may be working on a issue/bug fix/feature that requires a particular code available now. If some other contributor decides to change the code in the remote repository and if Git automatically pulls the repo, we may not notice the changes in the code and may run into errors. Making it mandatory for manually pulling the repo makes us conscious of the changes in the repository and makes us less likely to commit errors.
