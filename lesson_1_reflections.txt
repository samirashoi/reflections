How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed me the difference in the code in the two files. So it was easier visually to find the bug. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can save lots of time that would be wasted comparing code manually.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	I can choose what I want to save when I commit myself, not whatever file I've changed.	
    But I may forget to commit a change I made. This would lead to loss of that code if I ever changed it again. 
	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I guess it's because git is used to save a whole lot of files while GDocs is used for single documents at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the ability to see all the commits that are made for the project. git diff shows the difference in the different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It helps me to experiment with my code more since I do not have to worry about breaking it. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git for storing my code in all my future projects.
